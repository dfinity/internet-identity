# Screenshots

These screenshots are generated by running the following commands:

``` bash
npm run showcase&
npm run screenshots
```

That will generate screenshots in `screenshots/custom/`.

We commit these screenshots (generated on CI in `desktop/` and `mobile/`) so that changes
to the UI can be reviewed nicely in the PR.
