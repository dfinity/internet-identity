# Documentation

The official Internet Identity documentation. This documentation is deployed to
the [smartcontracts.org](https://smartcontracts.org) Developer documentation by
[Antora](https://antora.org). The Antora set up does _not_ live in this repo.

## Specification

The Internet Identity specification is written in Markdown ([MDX]) and rendered through [docusaurus]. We strive for _some_ readability in the GitHub rendered file but ultimately focus on the official, docusaurus-rendered [page on internetcomputer.org](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ii-spec/).
