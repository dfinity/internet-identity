/// and adding new ones).

/// counter. This means that this infrastructure should not be used to count events that are
/// expected to happen less frequently than once per day.

///     - ActiveAnchorCounter: used to track unique active anchors
///     - IIDomainCounter: used to track unique active anchors per domain
