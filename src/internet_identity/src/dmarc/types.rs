//! Mirrors `docs/ongoing/email-recovery.md` §6.6. The canister-side
//! verifier accepts a message only when [`DmarcOutcome`] is `Aligned`
//! *or* `NoRecord` with the DKIM `d=` matching the From-header domain
//! exactly (i.e. when the lack of a published DMARC record can still
//! be inferred from a coincidentally-aligned signature). Misaligned
//! mail is rejected outright; there is no "spoofing suspected" middle
//! state because the call has no value if the proof isn't a usable one.

/// surface an informational reason ("the sending domain says this

/// recovery flow rejects misaligned mail regardless of policy. The
