# Stable Memory Tests

These tests serve two purposes:
* Ensure backward compatibility with our stable memory format.
* Show that we can indeed fully recover in case of a disaster, assuming
  we have a backup of the stable memory.

## Stable Memory Backups

The following stable memory backups are currently used:
* `buffered_archive_entries_v9.bin.gz`: a backup with buffered archive entries.
* `genesis-layout-migrated-to-v9.bin.gz`: a backup initially created with the first version of the stable memory layout and then incrementally migrated to the v8 layout. It contains a few well-known identities / devices, see `known_devices` in `tests/integration/stable_memory.rs`.
* `genesis-memory-layout.bin`: a backup of the initial memory layout. Not migrated. Mainly used to test behavior with respect to outdated / unsupported memory layouts.
* `multiple-recovery-phrases-v9.bin.gz`: a backup with an identity that has multiple recovery phrases. The input validation does no longer allow to create such an identity (only one recovery phrase is allowed). However, legacy users that are in that state need a way to make their identity consistent again. This backup is used to test exactly that.
* `persistent_state_archive_v9.bin.gz`: a backup to check that archive state and configuration are restored correctly.
* `persistent_state_no_archive_v9.bin.gz`: a backup to check that persistent state without an archive is restored correctly. 

## Creating New Test Memory Backups

### Using Canister Test Infrastructure
These backup memory files are generated using the `canister_tests` infrastructure. To create a new backup file:
1. Install II on the `StateMachine`
    ```rust
    let env = StateMachine::new();
    let canister_id = install_ii_canister(&env, framework::II_WASM.clone());
    ```
2. Create the desired state in II by interacting with it.
3. Export the stable memory using the helper function provided by the `framework`:
    ```rust
    framework::save_compressed_stable_memory(&env, canister_id, "stable_memory/stable.bin.gz", "stable_memory/stable.bin.gz");
    ```
### Using the Local Replica

The stable memory can also be copied from the local replica from the following path `DFX_STATE/state/replicated_state/node-100/state/tip/canister_states/CANISTER_ID/stable_memory.bin`, where DFX_STATE expands to:
* on mac os: `~/Library/Application Support/org.dfinity.dfx/network/local`
* on linux: `$HOME/.local/share/dfx/network/local`
* for legacy projects where dfx.json defines the local network (relative to `dfx.json`): `dfx/network/local`

## Registering the DFX Key as II Device

Registering the `dfx` public key in II can be useful for testing as certain calls (e.g. `register`) require the `caller` to match the submitted public keys.

To register dfx as a device:
1. Export the key in the DER file format:
    ```bash
    dfx identity export IDENTITY | openssl ec -out FILE_NAME -pubout -outform der
    ```
2. Make sure that the current `dfx` identity matches the one exported in step 1
    ```bash
    dfx identity use IDENTITY
    ```
3. Register an anchor using `dfx` (assuming DUMMY_CAPTCHA, otherwise the actual challenge `chars` have to be submitted)
    ```bash
    challenge_key=$(dfx canister call II_CANISTER_ID create_challenge --candid src/internet_identity/internet_identity.did | sed -n 's/.*challenge_key[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*"\(.*\)".*/\1/p')
    pubkey_blob=$(hexdump -ve '1/1 "%.2x"' DER_PUBKEY_FILE_NAME | sed 's/../\\&/g')
    dfx canister call II_CANISTER_ID \
        register "(record{pubkey=blob \"$pubkey_blob\";alias=\"dfx test key\";purpose=variant{authentication};key_type=variant{unknown};protection=variant{unprotected};},record{key=\"$challenge_key\";chars=\"a\"})" \
        --candid src/internet_identity/internet_identity.did
    ```
**Note:** It is recommended to do this with an identity that is stored _unencrypted_. Otherwise, the passphrase has to be entered for every single `dfx` command.
