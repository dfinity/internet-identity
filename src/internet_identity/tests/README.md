# Internet Identity Tests

This is a test suite for the Internet Identity canister. To run the tests:

```bash
./scripts/test-canisters.sh -p internet_identity
```

_NOTE: you can also run the tests with `cargo test -p internet_identity --release` which takes much longer to build, but the tests are then orders of magnitude faster._
