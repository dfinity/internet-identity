# `try-ii`

Welcome to the Internet Identity Flow demo application. This project demonstrates how to implement user authentication using the new Internet Identity Flow.

## Getting Started

To learn more about Internet Identity and authentication on the Internet Computer, see the following documentation:

- [Internet Identity Documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/internet-identity/)
- [Authentication Overview](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/internet-identity/auth-overview)

## Running the project locally

To run the demo application locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Features

This demo application showcases:

- User authentication using Internet Identity

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd try-ii/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm run dev
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
