    "instead_of_passwords": "Instead of using passwords to sign-in, you unlock your device to authorize the use of a passkey. Passkeys are built on a standardized technology that offers protection against phishing attacks. This makes Internet Identity both more convenient and secure than traditional sign-in methods.",

    "no_tracking": "No Tracking",
    "get_privacy": "Get the privacy of many separate accounts, without the burden of managing them. When you create an account with a dapp using Internet Identity, a new set of authentication keys are created and managed for that dapp. This way, your identity cannot be tracked across dapps or websites.",

Internet Identity creates a public key for every dapp, so that you cannot be tracked across services. You use your device to authorize sessions instead of signing individual transactions. By signing a session, you authorize a scoped delegation that frees you to enjoy the dapp without signing every interaction.",
