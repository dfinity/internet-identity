        The base font size is dependent on the browser's window size. But 1rem

          There are a bunch of other text helpers that can be used to style text
          within a paragraph or anywhere else. One of the rare elements that has
          a default style is a <a href="#">link</a>, but sometimes you might
          want an other element to look like a link. In that case you can use
          the <code>.t-link</code> class. In some rare cases we want links to
          look less prominent (by removing the underline) you can use the
          <code>.t-link--discreet</code> class.

          A section, much like a text-paragraph, is a visually distinct area of
          the app. In our case it just sets a space to the top. It can be used
          with the <code>.l-stack</code> class. Sometimes we want there to be
          more spaces between sections. In that case we can use the
          <code>.l-stack--spacious</code> modifier class.
